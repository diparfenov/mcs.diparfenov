                    <h1>Mexican Soup</h1><br>
                    <p> Heat a small amount of cooking oil in a large cooking pot. 
                        Add finely chopped onion and minced garlic into the oil and 
                        cook until soft and fragrant. Add crushed tomatoes into the pot, 
                        along with the black beans, followed by the chicken broth and water. 
                        Bring the mixture to a boil. Time to add the other soup ingredients. 
                        Add the chicken breast, and chopped chile peppers, along with the taco 
                        seasoning. Simmer everything together until the chicken is no longer 
                        pink. Remove the chicken from the soup mix and use two forks to shred 
                        it. Add it back to the soup pot, along with the black beans and corn, 
                        and let everything simmer for another 5 minutes. While the soup simmers, 
                        prepare the toppings. Slice avocado, shred some cheese, chop green onions, 
                        and prepare some crunchy tortilla chips. When the soup is ready, ladle into 
                        bowls, add the toppings, and serve while still hot. Top with cheese, sour 
                        cream, avocado, and tortilla chips. </p>
